// nodemon(dependency) : it is an utility use to automatically restart the server whenever the backend
//                      code will manipulate or update otherwise we have to restart the terminal frequently
// we can intall it as dependency as well as Dev dependency 

// Dependency : means in production it will push on git
// Dev-Dependency : on in developing time it will be in use (npm i -D nodemon)

// but how nodemon will detect that on which of the file automode is ..
// so in scripts set : "dev" : "nodemon src/index.js"
